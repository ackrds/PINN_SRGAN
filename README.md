# PINN_SRGAN

This is a side project i have been working on as part of my thesis project. The network uses GANs and PINN loss functions to predict 
fluid flow. It has been built as an improvement on the work of another group. I will link their github below. Once you download the data, use the data_gen.py file to create data. Make sure to keep track of the data you are generating, I would suggest creating 60-70 samples. Link the loss.py file to the model file; the PINN loss function is in there.
